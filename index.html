His perfect learning roadmaps, assignments helped me to learn Swift quickly. His code reviews helped me to improve as a developer every day. He is highly experienced and down to earth. I could approach him for every small or big problem, the knowledge gap never came in between also he used to own team's problems that's the best thing about his personality.
